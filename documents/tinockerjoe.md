**[2025-06-02 21:37:29]** *A grey skinned elf with dark brown eyes and some visible scars on the partially shaven side of his head of his head sits opposite the large bugbear.  He wears studded leather over travel worn and dusty clothes, but the armor seems well oiled in spite of multiple scratches and repairs.  He has his shield strapped on his bag at his feet, a book  and hand crossbow in holsters on one side of his belt, and a short sword with a slight forward curve on the opposite hip.  He has a lean muscular build and sits with good posture and holds eye contact briefly then continues scanning the room with his eyes.  He idly rubs the ring on his finger as he clears his throat.*

**[2025-06-02 21:45:28]** "Pleasure to meet you Korrin." *His voice is deeper than his frame and build would indicate and the er sounds come out as uh* "I am Arkath Grey and if my scars do not cause you concern, then nothing about your appearance concerns me." *a brief hint of a smile on his usual serious expression* "I also investigate disturbances to what you refer to as the natural balance.  The Raven Queen does not care for such things as well."

**[2025-06-03 12:30:45]** *Pulling his attention away from Aurexx, Arkath glances Nico’s way* “As you know, my studies focus on supernatural occurrences.  The well placed bribe keeps many on the lookout for certain patterns. Disappearances.  Sightings of things strange and macabre.  Abhorrent or divine artifacts surfacing. When I received word that such goings on had transpired here, I reached out to our associates about getting some help. Oh, and I reached to you because I think you still owe me a few ales. *slight smile that disappears quickly before glancing around the room and settling once again on Aurexx* “That is an interesting instrument.    I would very much like to hear its story.”

**[2025-06-03 20:57:03]** `At the banging of the door from the stranger's entrance Arkath slides his hands toward his shield and crossbow.` (Does the mention of Barovia mean anything to Arkath.  May Arkath make a check to know if the stranger's appearance/behavior give any indication that they are Fey or Fiend?)

**[2025-06-03 21:02:39]** (Does Arkath recognize the seal on the letter?)

**[2025-06-04 05:22:11]** (Would either of those qualify for my Hunter’s Bane class feature?)

**[2025-06-04 09:51:48]** (I rolled in DND beyond. That was a 19 for History of Barovia and a 19 forArcana on Arrigal. I rolled with advantage for the Arcana, but the first of the two rolls was the 19 just in case I wasn’t supposed to roll with advantage.)

**[2025-06-04 09:55:23]** `Eyes focused on Arrigal` “Would you mind reading that Nico?”

**[2025-06-04 18:48:13]** *I feel like I should have heard of the Barovia, but in all my studies this name eludes me.  I think I would have noticed a town or manor along the west road. And why do I feel like this figure knows us without introduction.* “Does it seem safe Nico?  I would hate to travel 5 hours into the Svalich only to be ambushed.” `Arkath goes to sip his ale, but he chokes and sputters at the unexpected taste of Ubmub. Trying to compose himself` “Enough with the suspense Nico, what does it say?”

**[2025-06-04 21:01:43]** `At the mention of the word Vampyr Arkath’s face darkens and his attention shifts to the letter. As Nico finishes reading Arkath stands.` “I’m already packed and I’d prefer to leave tonight, but” `Shouldering his pack` “I’m not fool hardy enough to go alone. If we’re setting out tomorrow I’d like to leave at first light.  Innkeeper, how much for a room?” (Hearing about what’s happening to Ireena, does that sound like typical vampire behavior?)

**[2025-06-04 21:03:58]** `No matter the Innkeeper’s answer, Arkath will look to the others for their response`

**[2025-06-05 05:37:15]** `At the loud sound of the chair scraping, Arkath would like to don his shield. When the thugs laugh and get rowdy, he will attempt to subtly tap one of his runes to cast Armor of Agathys and start stealthily moving towards an advantageous place in the bar to have a clear shot at the thug(s).  Preferably with cover`  *Looks like it won’t be a quiet evening after all*  “We might want to spread out”   `He whispers to the others as he starts moving`

**[2025-06-06 07:00:27]** *Drunks don’t necessarily deserve to die for stupidity.  Apologies, my Queen. Thank you for staying my hand*  `Arkath returns his crossbow to its place on his hip, then draws a dagger. He attempts to stealthily get within range and prepares to throw the dagger so the butt strikes the lead thug non-lethally`
