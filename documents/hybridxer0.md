**[2025-06-02 21:24:08]** `A large bugbear steps forward wearing a practical dark purple sleeveless tunic with gold trim and bindings, paired with dark pants and sturdy brown boots. Gold fabric wraps around his arms and waist like martial arts bindings. The outfit perfectly blends his monastic training with practical adventuring gear.`  `He speaks quietly, his dark eyes thoughtful:` "I'm Korrin Lefstryde. I know my appearance might be.... *concerning.* I was raised by druids and trained at a monastery. I like to  investigate disturbances to the natural balance."   `He glances around at the group, nods, and finished with,` "A pleasure to meet you."

**[2025-06-03 11:00:51]** `Korrin's amber eyes move thoughtfully between his new companions, taking in details with the careful observation of someone trained in both monastic discipline and natural awareness. His large frame shifts slightly forward as he speaks, voice remaining soft but carrying genuine interest.`  "Arkath .... Grey", `he says, seeming to try study the name with a cocked head,` "—a fitting name for one who serves the Raven Queen. Your scars speak of experience, and I've read often of those who've faced genuine hardship; they often see truth more clearly than others." `He nods respectfully.` "The natural balance I speak of includes the cycles of life and death. Perhaps our purposes align more than they initially appear."  `His gaze turns to the masked figure, and something in his posture suggests both curiosity and a deep, instinctive respect.` "Aurexx... there's something profound about music that calls to the forgotten. In my studies, I've found that plants respond to certain melodies—they remember seasons past in ways we barely understand." `He pauses, tilting his head slightly.` "An unfinished hymn led you here?" `His expression darkens, as his brow furrows. His eyes go distant for a second and he murmers,` "The mist that swallows villages rarely does so without reason."  `Korrin's attention shifts to the approaching half-elf, his keen eyes noting the luminous quality of Nico's grey eye with the same careful observation he might give to an unusual flower or cloud formation. He inclines his head politely.`  "It seems you and Arkath here have worked together before? `His gaze briefly flicks to Aurexx, then back to Nico.` "I confess I'm intrigued to learn what message brought you here. Coincidences like this..." `he trails off thoughtfully, absently noting how the tavern's sparse plant life seems slightly more vibrant in their immediate corner.` "What drew you to answer Arkath's call, if you don't mind my asking?"

**[2025-06-03 14:05:11]** `Korrin is startled, flinching only slightly, as he had not noticed her due to her stature. He nods respectfully to Aria, his eyes taking note of her confident bearing despite her small stature.`  "Well met, Aria. You're right—this doesn't feel..... *random.*" `He glances around the table at the assembled group.` "Five different paths, all leading to the same mist-covered village. That suggests... ***purpose...***" `He seemed to muse on this for a bit, then leans forward slightly,` "What brought you here? I suspect your story might help us understand why we've all arrived at the same time."

**[2025-06-04 09:25:16]** (I'd like to know if Korrin knows more about the sigil in question, if he's come across in his books)

**[2025-06-04 11:43:18]** `Korrin leans forward, studying the wax closely. He’s not a scholar of noble houses, but as a druid he’s learned what ravens mean in the wild.`   “Ravens,” `he says,` “in every forest I’ve walked, they’re omens of death’s passage or the coming of winter—sometimes tied to the Raven Queen herself. But a raven clutching a sword?? I’ve never seen that exact motif in any druidic text or tribal glyph. If it’s not a personal crest of some local lord, it might well be a nod to death’s hand in war—something even a forest-dweller could sense. I don’t recall any official order using that seal, so I’d treat it like a warning: whoever sent this isn’t playing at hospitality.”   `His look of concern almost instantly changes when he becomes distracted by the smell of bananas, his interest and attention now focused on sampling this... *Ubmub*`

**[2025-06-04 20:08:01]** `After taking a huge gulp of the delicious beverage, suprised by it's allure, Korrin turns to Nico and says,` "I don't see any magic, but that raven… I’ve seen them overhead before a harsh winter or when a fire seized the woods. Here, it feels colder—like a warning."  `After pausing in thought, he continues,` " I don’t know any noble house that bears this mark. Doesn’t read like a crest, more like someone staking a claim. Trust your gut, Nico: whoever sent this wants something, and they’re not hiding behind fancy titles.”

**[2025-06-05 16:31:55]** `Korrin’s ears twitch at Arkath’s whisper. He tightens the wrappings on his forearms and shifts his weight, low stance ready. With a slow breath that smells of pine and damp earth, he slips around in a wide circle around the tavern`  `He murmurs under his breath,` “And I was just enjoying myself..."   `His eyes, dark and steady, track the scarred thug’s movements as he closes the distance, fingers brushing the old grimoire at his side—ready to call on the forest’s breath if blood spills. Korrin’s shoulders coil with silent tension, every muscle primed to spring.`

**[2025-06-05 23:44:34]** `Korrin moves fast—too fast for a drunk to track.  One heartbeat he’s by the shutters. The next, he’s behind the lead thug.  No warning. Just a sharp, clean strike to the ribs.  Korrin doesn’t say a word. Just plants his feet, ready to hit again if the fool’s still standing.`

**[2025-06-06 09:29:57]** `Korrin exhales slowly, fist still lowered from the strike. He doesn’t press the attack. Instead, he plants his feet, eyes sweeping the room—not in fear, but in calculation.`  *By the Hells…* `he thinks,` *why do these situations always seem to find me?*  `He glances to Nico, then Arkath, Aurexx, and finally Ber, giving them the barest nod—as if to say: Your turn.`
