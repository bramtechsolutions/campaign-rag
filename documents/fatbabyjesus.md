**[2025-06-03 18:29:25]** `The tavern door * groans * open just as Nico mentions the name of the tavernâ€™s infamous banana brew. A tall figure fills the frameâ€”broad-shouldered, road-worn, and carrying a presence that pulls attention whether he wants it or not.`  `His armor is a patchwork of hardened leather and half plate, beaten and scored from years of use. The mix of greens, browns, and grays blends well with forest or battlefield alikeâ€”though now itâ€™s dusted with road grit and mist. A halberd rests slung across his back, and a greatsword hangs at his side with a large sigil that dangles from its hilt. His dark brown hair is damp from the fog, and his brown eyes flick from face to face with a slow, deliberate calm.`  `He stops just inside the threshold, sizing up the group and the room in equal measure.`  "Did I hear someone say theyâ€™re buying?" `He steps forward, one brow arched and a crooked half-smile forming.` "Because if thereâ€™s beer on the table, Iâ€™ve already found my purpose."  `He gives a brief nod to Nico, then Arkath, then the rest of the gathered strangers. Not unfriendly, but watchfulâ€”like a man whoâ€™s learned to take his time trusting.`  `His hand rests lightly on the pommel of his swordâ€”not a threat, just habit.` `Then he sets his pack beside a chair and eases into it with a faint grunt.`  "Nameâ€™s Ber. Iâ€™m here because too many folk have gone quiet in places that should never go still. Something's off in the air, and the mist outside stinks of it."

**[2025-06-03 20:07:14]** `Ber watches the stranger approach, eyes narrowing beneath his furrowed brow. He doesnâ€™t reach for a weaponâ€”but one hand casually drifts toward the hilt of his greatsword, resting there like someone checking the weight of a familiar thought.`  `When the letter hits the table, Ber doesnâ€™t pick it up. Instead, he leans back slightly in his chair, eye twitching just once.`  "First light, huh? Thatâ€™s generous. Usually these kinds of invitations come after the screaming starts."  `His tone is dry, voice gravel-edged and calm.` `He glances around at the others, lifts his mug in a half-toast.`  "Hereâ€™s to waking up early and marching into haunted woods for a man who wonâ€™t even show his face."  `Then, quieter, almost to himself:` *Still better than sitting around pretending the quiet out there means peace.*  `He takes a sip, then nods toward the letter without looking at it.`  "Someone want to read that thing out loud before I start sharpening steel for a polite breakfast visit?"

**[2025-06-04 21:22:14]** `Ber watches the brightly-dressed messenger stride off with the kind of confidence only a man with no intention of joining the fight can afford.` `He exhales through his noseâ€”something between a sigh and a quiet snortâ€”and leans forward, resting heavy forearms on the scarred tavern table.`  "Right. At first light it is." `He taps the table once with two fingers, then picks up his half-finished drink.` "Better to face the woods with a bit of sleep and no regrets."  *Not that anyone sleeps well when the air feels like itâ€™s holding its breath.*  `As he takes a sip, the letter's contents echo in his mindâ€”especially one line.`  ðŸ’­ *Bitten by a Vampyrâ€¦*  *Thatâ€™s not a warning. Thatâ€™s a confession. And itâ€™s too damn calm.*  `Ber sets the mug down and glances around the table, his tone low.` "Anyone else catch that line? Not attacked, not hunted... bitten. Like he let it happen to her.. Or like he didnâ€™t get a choice." `He shakes his head once.` "Either way, thatâ€™s a bad way to start a letter. Hope the rest of the storyâ€™s better than the prologue."  `With a groan of old armor and tired joints, Ber rises from his seat. The battered plates of brown, green, and grey leather shift with him, bearing scars whispering their own stories of battle. He gives the group a nod.` "Getting a room. If weâ€™re marching at dawn, I want four walls, a door that locks, and something dry to sleep on."  `He crosses the tavern floor, boots thudding solidly on old boards, and approaches the barkeep.`  "Evening. Room for one, just for tonight. I donâ€™t snore. Much." *He sets a few coins down, then adds, almost as an afterthought:* "And if anyone knocks past midnight, and they ainâ€™t breathing rightâ€”just tell â€™em I already paid my tithe to the dead this month."
