**[2025-06-02 23:48:29]** `The figure seated at the table corner closest to the hearth does not immediately speak. Tall and wiry, he is cloaked in shadow and wrapped in tattered cloak, midriff exposing his brownish-charcoal skin. A white, marble mask conceals his face—its expression mournful and unchanging, horns sprouting form the top. His viol rests in his lap, charcoal-black and silver-strung, held with reverent care. His tail coils beside one leg of the bench, the pointed tip tapping a faint rhythm against the wood. With a final pluck of his viol’s string, he lifts his head. The red-outlined, black lenses of his mask catch the firelight as he scans the room, but reveal nothing.`  "I am called Aurexx."  `His voice is soft, deliberate, almost melodic—like a song played slowly in reverse.`  "I lend my voice to those who linger... and remember the ones the world has chosen to forget. I do not summon the dead...  They come to listen when I play."  `A brief pause, as if weighing whether more is necessary.`  "I followed a voice not my own... a hymn unfinished. It led me here, to this village swallowed by mist. Why? I do not know..."  `Then he falls silent once more, his gloved fingers resting gently against the strings.`

**[2025-06-03 20:27:58]** `At Korrin’s words—"The mist that swallows villages rarely does so without reason"—the gentle tapping of Aurexx’s tail pauses. Stillness stretches for a breath, as if the thought hangs in the air too heavily to ignore.` `Then, softly, the rhythm resumes.`  `He turns his veiled gaze to Arkath as if to answer... but his answer is interrupted by the man with jingling coin that entered the tavern. Aurexx’s head does not turn towards this man, but instead returns to the viol in his lap, fingers tracing the edge of a silver string, not even looking up towards the letter that was dropped onto the table.`

**[2025-06-04 21:21:40]** `As the letter is read aloud, Aurexx’s tail ceases its rhythm again.` `But this time, it does not resume.`  `He doesn’t look up. He doesn’t move.` `His masked face remains tilted toward the viol in his lap, fingers gently tracing the wood, not playing... simply listening.`  *Barovia. Ireena. Indirovich.* *These names echo like dissonant chords in my ears...*  `Aurexx completely stops moving for a moment, even from breathing, as if listening to something, before resuming his usual delicate, soft movements.`  "I feel I have heard these names... though from what tune, I cannot recall..." `His voice is no louder than before, but it cuts through the crackle of the hearth.` "Perhaps they are threads in the song I am meant to find."  `He repositions his viol, ever gazing down towards it.`  "If Barovia mourns... then I must go where the threnody rings."
