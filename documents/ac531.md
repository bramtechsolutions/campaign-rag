**[2025-06-03 10:50:17]** `Nico, a slender half-elf nursing a mead standing at the bar, hearing the familiar voice of Arkath introduce himself to Korrin, turns and walks over to join the group. His grey eye has an almost luminous quality in the tavern light.`  "Ah, Arkath good to see you, I was wondering what your message to meet was about, who are your new friends?"

**[2025-06-03 16:23:56]** `Nico noticing his mug almost empty looks around the table and announces` "You two are correct, there must be a reason we are all here..."  `Looks at Aria, Aurexx, & Korrin ` "I have a feeling we are waiting for another, while we wait I owe Arkath a drink or two, how about you Aurexx, Aria & Korrin? I hear this tavern has a concoction called Ubmub... It has hints of Banana."

**[2025-06-03 21:53:17]** `Nico unsure of what is happening does a half-toast back to Ber, looking slowly from the bag of gold, to Arrigal, to the rest of the party, and focuses on the handwriting on the envelope and the seal.`

**[2025-06-04 12:44:37]** (Before reaching for the letter to read, I'd like to do an Arcana check on the envelope itself)

**[2025-06-04 20:02:31]** "I wouldn't say this letter is *dangerous* but there is something *lingering*. "  `Nico takes a shot of Ubmub`  "Unless there is an objection, I guess I can take a gander at this...."

**[2025-06-04 20:24:20]** `Nico takes another shot after finishing the letter...` `Speaks to something not in the party` "Well, I can die or get rich, win/win." `Looking around` ""Oh you dont hear the voices..? 'd say lets take this. I'd vote lets take this hike..."

**[2025-06-05 11:42:00]** (Does Nico notice if these thugs have any sort of coin in their group or if they are speaking in thieves' cant?)

**[2025-06-05 22:20:16]** `Nico remembering the words from the adventure with Arkath "Next time stay behind me", takes the opportunity to slink into the Shadows behind the group. His fingers brush the hilt of his short sword, but rest upon his daggers.`

**[2025-06-05 22:47:54]** `Noticing the twitches of Korrin's ears, and the change in stance, Nico uses prestidigitation to make a sparkler/shower of sparks to draw the gaze of the thugs away from the group and Korrin`
