**[2025-05-18 05:26:57]** > The mists creep low along the ground, curling like pale fingers around your boots as a chill wind whispers your name. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf howls—lonely, mournful, hungry. The sun is but a memory here, smothered by thick clouds that never part, and the land itself seems to brood under a sky that never smiles.  > You have been summoned—whether by fate, fortune, or cruel trickery—to the dread land of Barovia, a realm cloaked in sorrow and shadow. The people speak in hushed voices, their eyes wary, their homes ringed with garlic and superstition. They dare not speak too loudly of Castle Ravenloft, the looming fortress that watches from its crag like a vulture over a dying corpse.  > Within its ancient halls dwells Count Strahd von Zarovich, an immortal tyrant and vampire lord whose cold, calculating gaze has pierced the hearts of Barovians for centuries. His power is absolute, his appetite unending, and now... his attention has turned to you.  > Will you rise to become the hope of this cursed land, or will your blood join the countless others spilled in the mists of Ravenloft? Steel your hearts, sharpen your blades, and remember: In Barovia, not even the dead rest easy.

**[2025-06-02 20:57:30]** **Session 1: Whispers Before the Mist**

**[2025-06-02 21:02:57]** > The wind howls like a wounded beast beyond the timbered walls of the Hollow Hearth Inn.  Outside, the village of Briar Glen lies wrapped in fog. Not the natural mist of an autumn storm—but something denser, more purposeful. Lanternlight dies within it. Sound is swallowed whole. No traveler who entered this evening has dared leave again.

**[2025-06-02 21:05:01]** > Yet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the tumbling voices of country folk.   > You find yourselves in a dimly lit tavern, its wooden beams creaking softly overhead. The scent of ale and hearth smoke hangs in the air, the sound of muffled conversations, music, and the crackle of the fireplace. The tavern is cozy yet weathered, its walls adorned with faded tapestries and shelves cluttered with mementos of travelers long gone.  > The hearth casts a warm glow across the room, illuminating the faces of the patrons gathered around the tables. Some are lost in their own thoughts, nursing their drinks in silence, while others engage in lively conversation, their laughter filling the room with warmth.  > At the entrance of the tavern, just beneath the soft glow of lantern light, stands a long, sturdy table hewn from aged oak. It bears the scars of countless meals shared and tales told. A row of simple benches flank either side of the table.   > Seated upon these benches are six figures, their silhouettes illuminated by the flickering torchlight.

**[2025-06-02 21:11:47]** @Curse of Strahd [PBP] (I would now like everyone to introduce their characters.)

**[2025-06-03 19:33:48]** > Each of you came to Briar Glen for your own reasons. Yet none of you arrived without sensing it—a shift in the air, a weight in your chest, a silence where once there was harmony. The village seemed to call, though none of you received a formal summons until tonight.  - Korrin, the seeker of natural balance, felt the forests recoiling—not from blight, but from something watching.  - Arkath, the hunter of mysteries, was drawn by patterns: disappearances, ritual signs, and unmarked graves.  - Aurexx, led by a half-remembered hymn and a voice not his own, followed a song unfinished.  - Nico, haunted by whispers in the glass, noticed that the mists had begun to mirror his own movements. One village vanished. Then another. All without a sound.  - Arialyn, stalwart and unshaken, was pulled here by dreams of shadowed halls and the feeling that her order’s vows would be tested before long.  - Ber, the sword of judgment, followed silence—the kind that follows screams. Villages dead quiet. No signs of struggle. Just... nothing.

**[2025-06-03 19:36:28]** > Suddenly, the tavern door swings open, and a hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence.

**[2025-06-03 19:37:19]** > In an accented voice he says,   “I have been sent to you to deliver this message. If you are creatures of honor, you will come to my Master’s aid at first light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!”   > His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. He stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms. He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in a beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table.

**[2025-06-03 19:49:22]** “Take the west road from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia.”  > Amid the silent stares of the patronage, the man strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep,   “Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously parched.”   > He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar.

**[2025-06-03 22:41:34]** @Tinockerjoe **Arkath make an Arcana or Religion check for Barovia knowledge, and either Arcana or Insight for determining Arrigal’s nature. **

**[2025-06-03 22:55:12]** > Nico as you look at the letter, you see the wax bears the image of a raven clutching a sword, a symbol unfamiliar in formal heraldry—but evocative.

**[2025-06-04 12:00:46]** (It says you have advantage Survival and  Intelligence checks, this would be an Arcana or Religion check so Hunter's Bane would not apply here)

**[2025-06-04 12:02:38]** @THE  H Y B R I D™ **Korrin please make an Arcana or Religion check to see if you know more about the sigil in question**  ㅤ

**[2025-06-04 12:04:53]** @Tinockerjoe  **– Arcana (Arkath): 19 - Arrigal**  > You study the stranger. His colors, his cadence, the way he moved—it’s all too precise, too practiced. He doesn’t feel like a simple traveler. You detect no trace of fiendish or fey magic on him, yet his presence felt... thin—like he could vanish into mist at any moment. Whatever Arrigal is, he’s no illusion.

**[2025-06-04 12:08:05]** @Tinockerjoe  **History (Arkath): 19 – The Name Barovia**  > You close your eyes for just a moment, mind flicking through volumes read and lore gathered—the shelves of Evereska’s libraries, the ruins of the High Forest, even the mad journals of those you’ve tracked across the planes. You’ve made a life of tracing patterns—but Barovia?  > There’s nothing.

**[2025-06-04 13:55:59]** @AC **Nico, make an Arcana check on the envelope**

**[2025-06-04 18:25:29]** @AC  – **Arcana (Nico Varn): 21 - Envelope**  > As your fingers brush the edges of the envelope, you feel something… off. The parchment is thick, hand-made, but the ink shimmers faintly—not with light, but with absence. Like something is layered beneath the surface, hidden from the eye but not from the soul.  > Your trained senses pick up old magic, possibly binding magic, woven into the letter. Not a trap, but a seal—an arcane lock designed to ensure only the intended readers break it. Something about the energy suggests the message cannot be intercepted. It wants you to open it. It knows your name.  > The wax bears no enchantment, but it too resists scrutiny. As if it recognizes your touch, and dares you to look deeper. When you blink, the raven’s wings seem briefly extended—like shadow play on stone.  > Whatever power lingers in this message isn’t inherently hostile. But it is watching. > And it has already chosen you.

**[2025-06-04 18:32:24]** @THE  H Y B R I D™**  – Arcana (Korrin): 11 - Sigil**  > Your eye for natural lore and symbolic language serves you well when reading the world, but this seal eludes you. The raven feels familiar—like an omen you’ve seen before the coming of winter wolves or forest fires. Yet here it feels... colder.  > You sense no magic from the wax. No enchantment, no trick. But the feeling it gives you—that’s the warning. The kind no spell can create. > This is not a crest of heraldry. It’s a claim.

**[2025-06-04 20:12:18]** > As Nico breaks the wax seal, the table falls quiet.  > The parchment inside is crisp, edged with elegant red filigree, and the handwriting is smooth, flowing, and cold. The ink is deep black.  > Nico reads aloud:

**[2025-06-04 20:18:54]** > Hail thee of might and valor: >  > I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor—with despair. >  > My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer. >  > So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours. >  > There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life. >  > Kolyan Indirovich > Burgomaster

**[2025-06-04 21:06:50]** > Arkath. as your thoughts turn toward the word vampyr, something cold and instinctual coils in your gut. You've studied blood curses, shadow rites, and creatures that blur the line between man and myth—but "vampyr" is not just another name for vampire.  > It’s older. Hungrier. Deliberate.

**[2025-06-04 21:09:05]** > Something about the letter’s words tugs at each of you. ﻿ - Korrin, the balance you seek shudders. No cycle—natural or spiritual—survives under a predator that feeds without end. ﻿ - Arkath, this vampyr… it's unlike anything you’ve studied. Its influence feels ancient and dangerously precise. The letter may be a plea—but it’s also a warning of an apex predator. ﻿ - Aurexx, the names taste familiar. Not from memory—but from music. Barovia, Ireena, Indirovich… fragments from that lost hymn. The spirits stir. Some whisper their names. Others simply weep. ﻿ - Nico, the mirror shard on your person grows colder. The ink in the letter… somehow resembles the ink of that other tome you found all those years ago.  ﻿ - Aria, you feel the weight of an oath not yet spoken. Something sacred is unraveling in that place. You don't know how—but you know your vows will be tested. ﻿ - Ber, the mention of "bitten by a vampyr" brings back battlefield tales you always dismissed as superstition. This time, it feels real. And if there’s a devil to be fought—you've already made your peace with the cost.

**[2025-06-04 22:02:08]** > Ber, as you cross the tavern floor, the air seems to shift. Conversations hush—just slightly, just enough to notice—and all eyes flicker toward you and the bar.  > The barkeep, a bearded man with nervous eyes, forces a tense smile as you approach. But he doesn’t greet you. His gaze is fixed just past your shoulder.

**[2025-06-04 22:08:25]** > That’s when you hear the scrape of wood on wood—chairs shifting, boots stomping—and the raucous laughter of men who want to be heard. ﻿ > A burly thug with a scar splitting his upper lip reaches out and grabs the tankards the barkeep had just poured—your drinks. He turns toward you with a sneer, his gang close behind.

**[2025-06-04 22:14:40]** “Well, well... looks like grandpa needs to go to bed.” ﻿ >  He grins, gold tooth glinting in the firelight. Behind him, four more thugs lounge in chairs like wolves in tall grass, armed and half-drunk. ﻿ > Another snickers.  ﻿ “Came up here askin’ for a room, boys. Gonna tuck in early, old man? Want us to sing you a lullaby?” ﻿ > The lead thug raises his mug in a mocking toast.  ﻿ “You’re lucky we were here to catch your drinks before they got warm. That peacock messenger of yours paid up real nice. Real shame he forgot to mention they weren’t for us.”  > The others hoot and slap the bar.  > A wiry bandit with a broken nose chimes in, gesturing toward the rest of the party.   “These your kids, old man? Cute. Real mismatched little orphan gang you’ve got there.”  > The barkeep winces but says nothing—his hands tremble under the bar as he slowly slides a small knife beneath the counter, just in case.  > The scarred thug leans closer, the ale in his mug sloshing onto Ber’s boot.  “Tell you what, grandpa. Why don’t you take your bones upstairs and sleep this one off? We’ll make sure that coin is well spent..."  > He reaches out and grabs the tankards the barkeep had just poured.

**[2025-06-05 12:30:24]** @AC **Nico, roll a Perception check to spot coin purses or signs of wealth among the thugs.**  **Roll an Insight check to determine if any of their gestures or phrasing hint at underworld slang or coded speech.**

**[2025-06-05 16:25:34]** @AC  **Perception (Nico Varn) : 10 - Spotting coin**  > Your eyes flick toward their belts, boots, and hands—searching for the telltale glint of coin. Unfortunately, between the shifting bodies, spilled ale, and dim firelight, most of what you catch are bulky shapes beneath rough cloaks and clinking sounds masked by tankards slamming and chairs scraping.  > You don’t spot a clear purse or pouch—no flash of gold or ornate clasp—but it’s clear they’ve got something rattling in their pockets. Whether that’s coin, dice, or bones is anyone’s guess. ‎

**[2025-06-05 16:27:57]** @AC **Insight (Nico Varn) : 6 - Thieves' cant**  > You try to parse their jeering for signs of thieves' cant—hidden meanings, double-speak, or gang code. But their tone is too slurred, too mocking, and frankly, too loud to read any subtle signals. > If these men are part of the underground, they’re not showing it with finesse. More likely, they’re bullies used to getting their way, not clever agents of a guild.

**[2025-06-05 23:04:55]** > The air thickens, the scent of sweat and spilled ale clinging to the tavern’s wooden bones. The tension is a string pulled taut—just waiting for someone to pluck it.  > Korrin shifts into motion—graceful, silent. A predator in monk’s robes. > Arkath’s rune pulses as magical frost coats his shoulders, invisible but humming with promise. > Aria slides from her seat like a shadow learning to stand upright. > Nico, fingers twitching with arcane readiness, murmurs a minor incantation—  > A spray of sparks erupts from the opposite side of the tavern, casting dancing lights across the smoky rafters.  > The thugs flinch, a few looking up—one even ducks instinctively.  > Korrin, you see your chance.

**[2025-06-06 00:55:16]** @THE  H Y B R I D™ **Korrin make an unarmed strike.**

**[2025-06-06 09:16:19]** > The lead thug doesn’t even have time to scoff. ﻿ *CRACK.* ﻿ > Korrin’s fist drives into his ribs with such precision and force that bones audibly shift. The thug staggers sideways, a strangled gasp escaping him as all the breath is slammed from his chest. > ﻿ > He drops the tankard. The clang rings out like a bell tolling judgment. ﻿ > Behind the bar, the barkeep recoils. Across the room, chairs screech and boots shuffle—some in panic, others in preparation for violence. ﻿ > The thug stumbles, eyes wild. He opens his mouth to shout, but all that comes is a wheeze and a string of spit. ﻿ > His knees buckle. He doesn’t fall—but only just. ﻿ > Somewhere in the tavern, a bottle rolls off a table and shatters. ﻿ > The room is one heartbeat from chaos.
